A data science project using Telco dataset to predict customer churn with machine learning.

# Customer Churn Prediction

This project uses the Telecom Customer Churn dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn. 

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Logistic Regression (first model)

## âœ… Model Accuracy
**82.1%** on test set  
F1-score for churn class: **0.64**

## ðŸ§  Business Insight
- Fiber optic customers are more likely to churn
- Month-to-month contracts increase churn probability
- High monthly charges correlate with higher churn risk

## ðŸš€ Next Models/steps
- Random Forest & XGBoost
- Build interactive dashboard (Power BI or Tableau)
